# **App Name**: Nascad

## Core Features:

- Blender Import with Rigging: Import Blender (.blend) files, preserving rig data for immediate manipulation.
- Rig Control: Provide an advanced panel of rig controls (inverse kinematics, constraints, etc.)
- Object Transformation: Directly manipulate object position, rotation, and scale with precise numerical inputs or handles.
- Geometric Modeling: Provide tools for geometric primitive creation (cube, sphere, cylinder) and mesh editing (extrude, bevel) and advance geometry manipulation like blender that you can select and move around verticies, edge, faces.
- Scene Graph: Visualize object hierarchies, with easy re-parenting. Each item in the Scene Graph may have its visibility toggled on or off.
- Exporting: Export as .fbx for Unity or .obj for other platforms
- Parameter Optimization: The LLM as a tool which analyzes existing parameters to estimate an ideal setting, based on factors such as scene complexity, rendering method, and framerate goals.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft gray-blue (#A0B4C7), evoking calmness and precision.
- Background color: Off-white (#F4F4F2) for a clean and spacious feel.
- Accent color: Muted gold (#C4B38A) to indicate interactivity and high-end feel.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, which will contribute to a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use minimalist, vector-based icons for tools and actions.
- Employ a clean, tabbed interface with collapsible panels to maximize screen real estate.
- Incorporate subtle, fluid animations for transitions and user interactions.
